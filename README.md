# SFSUResourceDirectory
 
This repository is a conceptual resource directory, that would house links for various campus initiatives aimed at basic needs, academic support, and recreational activities. 

At the moment, the SF State website is poorly designed and doesn't have a streamlined page for emergency or essential resources.
